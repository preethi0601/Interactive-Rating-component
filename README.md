# Interactive-Rating-component

Design and boilerplate from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).


Check it out [here](https://preethi0601.github.io/Interactive-Rating-component/).
This is a star based rating component that lets you submit your choice and shows a thank you message.

What I learned while building this:
- Event listeners on how to implement show/hide
- how/when to use Flex and flex direction in CSS
